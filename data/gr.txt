in all your amours you should prefer old women to young ones you call this a paradox and demand my reasons they are these 1 because as they have more knowledge of the world and their minds are better stor’d with observations their conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable 2 because when women cease to be handsome they study to be good to maintain their influence over men they supply the diminution of beauty by an augmentation of utility they learn to do a 1000 services small and great and are the most tender and useful of all friends when you are sick thus they continue amiable and hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old woman who is not a good woman 3 because there is no hazard of children which irregularly produc’d may be attended with much inconvenience 4 because thro’ more experience they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an intrigue to prevent suspicion the commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your reputation and with regard to theirs if the affair should happen to be known considerate people might be rather inclin’d to excuse an old woman who would kindly take care of a young man form his manners by her good counsels and prevent his ruining his health and fortune among mercenary prostitutes 5 because in every animal that walks upright the deficiency of the fluids that fill the muscles appears first in the highest part the face first grows lank and wrinkled then the neck then the breast and arms the lower parts continuing to the last as plump as ever so that covering all above with a basket and regarding only what is below the girdle it is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one and as in the dark all cats are grey the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old woman is at least equal and frequently superior every knack being by practice capable of improvement 6 because the sin is less the debauching a virgin may be her ruin and make her for life unhappy 7 because the compunction is less the having made a young girl miserable may give you frequent bitter reflections none of which can attend the making an old woman happy 8thly and lastly they are so grateful

it would be perfect if everyone who makes love is in love but this is simply an unrealistic expectation id say 75 percent of the population of people who make love are not in love this is simply the reality of the human race and to be idealistic about this is to wait for the stars to aline and jupiter to change color for the heavens to etch your names together in the sky before you make love to someone but idealism is immaturity and as a matter of fact the stars may never aline jupiter may never change color and the heavens may never ever etch your names together in the sky for you to have the neverending permission to make endless love to one another and so the bottom line is there really is no difference between doing something and doing something tomorrow because is what you have and tomorrow may not turn out the way you expect it to at the end of the day sex is an animalistic humanistic passionate desire

two kisses in one kiss was all it took a comfort a warmth perhaps temporary perhaps false but reassuring nonetheless and mine and theirs ours all three of us giggling insane giggles and laughter with still more kisses on the way and i remember a brief instant then out of the blue when i suddenly glimpsed my own father a rare but oddly peaceful recollection as if he actually approved of my play in the way he himself had always laughed and played great updrafts of light burning off distant plateaus of bistre  sage throwing him up like an angel high above the red earth deep into the sparkling blank the tender sky that never once let him down preserving his attachment to youth propriety and kindness his plane almost but never quite outracing his whoops of joy trailing him in his sudden turn to the wind followed then by a near vertical climb up to the angles of the sun and i was barely eight and still with him and yes that was the thought that flickered madly through me a brief instant of communion possessing me with warmth and ageless ease causing me to smile again and relax as if memory alone could lift the heart like the wind lifts a wing and so i renewed my kisses with even greater enthusiasm caressing and in turn devouring their dark lips dark with wine and fleeting love an ancient memory love had promised but finally never gave until there were too many kisses to count or remember and the memory of love proved not love at all and needed a replacement which our bodies found and then the giggles subsided and the laughter dimmed and darkness enfolded all of us and we gave away our childhood for nothing and we died and condoms littered the floor and christina threw up in the sink and amber chuckled a little and kissed me a little more but in a way that told me it was time to leave

yet isnt it all—all of it every single episode and detail of the clinton saga—exactly like that and isnt some of it a little bit more serious for sen clinton something is true if it validates the myth of her striving and her greatness her overweening ambition in other words and only ceases to be true when it no longer serves that limitless purpose and we are all supposed to applaud the skill and the barefaced bravado with which this is done in the new hampshire primary in 1992 she knowingly lied about her husbands uncontainable sex life and put him eternally in her debt this is now thought of and referred to in print purely as a smart move on her part in the iowa caucuses of 2008 he returns the favor by telling a huge lie about his own record on the war in iraq falsely asserting that he was opposed to the intervention from the very start this is thought of and referred to in print as purely a tactical mistake on his part trying too hard to help the spouse the happy couple has now united on an equally mendacious account of what they thought about iraq and when they thought it what would it take to break this cheap little spell and make us wake up and inquire what on earth we are doing when we make the clinton family drama— yet again —a central part of our own politics

in its various forms so far as we know them love seems always to have a deep significance and a most practical importance to us little mortals in one form as the mere semiconscious sexlove which runs through creation and is common to the lowest animals and plants it appears as a kind of organic basis for the unity of all creatures in another as the love of the mother for her offspring—which may also be termed a passion—it seems to pledge itself to the care and guardianship of the future race in another as the marriage of man and woman it becomes the very foundation of human society and so we can hardly believe that in its homogenic form with which we are here concerned it has not also a deep significance and social uses and functions which will become clearer to us the more we study it
as luxenbergs work has only recently been published we must await its scholarly assessment before we can pass any judgements but if his analysis is correct then suicide bombers or rather prospective martyrs would do well to abandon their culture of death and instead concentrate on getting laid 72 times in this world unless of course they would really prefer chilled or white raisins according to their taste in the next

man knows himself as body and what he knows of spirit comes through grace the poet would call it inspiration but the spirit bloweth where it listeth man has no control over his inspiration if a piece of music or a poem has moved him once he can never be certain that it will happen again but man hates to think that he has no control over the spirit it would discourage him too much he likes to believe that he can summon the spirit by some ordinary act instead of striving to prepare himself for it through discipline and prayer he tries to summon it arbitrarily through some physical act—drinking düsseldorf beer for instance   stein said chuckling which is the way all good düsseldorfers summon the spirit since our dunkelbier is the best in germany the priest laughed with him and for a moment sorme had a curious impression that he was listening to an argument between two undergraduates instead of two men in their late sixties he shrank deeper into his armchair wanting them to forget his presence the priest stopped laughing first and sorme had a glimpse of the tiredness that always lay behind his eyes stein also became grave again he said very well but what has this to do with the murderer it has to do with sex for sex is the favourite human device for summoning the spirit and since it is also gods gift of procreation it nearly always works   unlike music and poetry or beer stein said quite but even sex is not infallible and man hates to think that he has no power over the spirit the more his physical methods fail him the more voraciously he pursues them his attempts to summon the spirit become more and more frenzied if he is a drinker he drinks more until he has more alcohol than blood in his veins if he is a sensualist he invents sexual perversions ah stein said there are many other ways of course—the lust for money and power for instance all depend upon mans refusal to face the fact that the spirit bloweth where it listeth that no physical act can be guaranteed to summon it

sexual conflict occurs when one mating partner has an opportunity to increase its fitness at a cost to the other partner  on a genetic level most sexual conflicts are interlocus conflicts that mainly concern the outcome of malefemale interactions about the mating rate fertility efficiency relative parental effort remating behavior and female reproductive rate  in sexually antagonistic evolution a trait that affords advantage to one sex is disadvantageous to the other  an example is the sexual arms race that evolves when resistance in one sex drives the evolution of coercive traits in the other sex  without the restrictions of natural selection this process may lead to a runaway amplification of male and female traits  the coevolutionary arms races between adaptations in one sex and counteradaptations in the other sex can be made visible by experimentally arresting evolution in one sex

theres folly in her stride thats the rumor justified by lies ive seen her up close beneath the sheets and sometime during the summer she was mine for a few sweet months in the fall and parts of december  to get to the heart of this unsolvable equation one must first become familiar with the physical emotional and immaterial makeup as to what constitutes both war and peace  i found her looking through a window the same window id been looking through she smiled and her eyes never faltered this folly was a crime  the very essence of war is destructive though throughout the years utilized as a means of creating peace such an equation might seem paradoxical to the untrained eye some might say using evil to defeat evil is counterproductive and gives more meaning to the word futile others like edmund burke would argue that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men and women to do nothing  she had an identity i could identify with something my fingertips could caress in the night  there is such a limitless landscape within the mind no two minds are alike and this is why as a race we will forever be at war with each other what constitutes peace is in the mind of the beholder  have you heard the argument this displacement of men and women and women and men the minds we all have the beliefs we all share slipping inside of us thoughts and religions and bodies all bare  without darkness there can be no light he once said to demonstrate this theory during one of his seminars he held a piece of white chalk and drew a line down the center of a blackboard explaining that without the blackness of the board the white line would be invisible  when she left she kissed with eyes open i knew this because id done the same sometimes we saw eye to eye like that very briefly she considered an apotheosis a synthesis a rendering of her folly into solidarity  to believe that a worldwide lay down of arms is possible however is the delusion of the pacifist the dream of the optimist and the joke of the realist diplomacy only goes so far and in spite of our efforts to fight with words there are times when drawing swords of a very different nature are surely called for  experiencing the subsequent sunrise inhaling and drinking breaking mirrors and regurgitating just to start again all in all i was just another gash in the bark  plato once said only the dead have seen the end of war perhaps the death of us all is called for in this time of emotional desperation war is a product of the mind only with the death of such will come the end of the bloodshed though this may be a fairly realistic view of such an issue perhaps there is an optimistic outlook on the horizon not every sword is double edged but every coin is double sided  leaving town and throwing shit out the window drinking boroughs and borrowing spare change i glimpsed the rear view mirror stole a glimpse really ive believed in looking back for a while it helps to have one last view a reminder in case one ever decides to rebel in the event the self regresses and makes the declaration of devastation once more  thus if we wish to eliminate the threat of war complete human annihilation may be called for

there we were filled with pure animal need as he pinned me to the wooden table and cruelly whipped my naked bottom the two of us sweaty and panting me screaming him grunting our primal sexual natures overprinting the tea room’s pretence at gentility and refinement
it was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body that really turned me on i was all he could think of as his lust got the better of him i glanced back and saw the underwear torn and discarded a little strip of thin black material on the floor and thought yes this is the kind of impatient sex i’m looking for the way they looked so small and cruelly forgotten was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts

he closed the door behind us and led me through to the back of the shop ‘if you don’t mind you can get changed in the stock cupboard’ he said ‘we’re not posh enough here to have staff changing rooms but you’ll soon get used to it’ ‘oh don’t worry chris’ i said warmly ‘i’m used to getting my clothes off in unusual places

the next day was rainsoaked and smelled of thick sweet caramel warm coconut and ginger a nearby bakery fanned its daily offerings a lapis lazuli sky was blanketed by gunmetal gray clouds as it wept crocodile tears across the parched los angeles landscape when ivy was a child and she overheard adults talking about their breakups in her young feebleformed mind she imagined it in the most literal of essences she once heard her mother speaking of her break up with an emotionally unavailable man she said they broke up on 69th street ivy visualized her mother and that man breaking into countless fragments like a spilled box of jigsaw pieces and she imagined them shattered in broken shards being blown down the pavement of 69th street for some reason on the drive home from marcel’s apartment that next morning all ivy could think about was her mother and that faceless man in broken pieces perhaps some aspects of them still stuck in cracks and crevices of the sidewalk mistaken as grit she couldn’t get the image of marcel having his seizure out of her mind it left a burning sensation in the center of her chest an incessant flame torched her lungs chest and even the back door of her tongue witnessing someone you cared about experiencing a seizure was one of those things that scribed itself indelibly on the canvas of your mind it was gutwrenching graphic and outofbody it was the stuff that post traumatic stress syndrome was made of

there is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex and the number of women that he is convinced he is in love with or the number of things that he is willing to do for a woman
there is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex and the number of women that he is convinced he is in love with

morfyd’s care as she walked out of the cave she passed annwyl walking in the girl had her swords in one hand the other hand held her ripped shirt and bindings over her ample breasts her brows angled down into a dark frown and she wouldn’t even look at morfyd as she passed how did that talk go then morfyd called over her shoulder shut up morfyd laughed as she advanced into the glen toward the clearing where she could take off she rounded a corner and came upon her brother his chainmail shirt and sword in his big hand heading toward the hidden entrance of his cave she watched him as he passed and she noticed the long scratches across his back how did that talk go then morfyd called over her shoulder shut up morfyd shook her head if love always made you this pathetic she wanted nothing to do with it
successful long term relationships are all about power levels a high power level male will attract and succeed with a high level power female how do we define those power levels we can’t they are inherently in us and invisible to scientists accountants psychologists and spiritualists alike none can explain the universe in its entirety and it is more than chemistry biology physics genetics horoscopes religion inlaws fame psychology and spirituality we may be infatuated by a person but as soon as we hold their hands kiss their lips and especially make love or have sex with them their power levels will be instantly exposed
i had a dream about you we made love for what seemed like eternity but was probably closer to forever you were happy i was happy the judges were happy and everybody in the audience was happy except for this one jerk who accused me of using performing enhancement drugs alcohol is not a performing enhancement drug

sexuality is the door to love and love is the door to silence to the divine
فشعر عندها فجأة برغبة غامضة لا تقاوم في سماع موسيقى هائلة، في سماع ضجيج مطلق وصخب جميل وفرح يكتنف كل شيء ويُغرق ويخنق كل شيء، فيختفي إلى الأبد الألم والغرور وتفاهة الكلمات
i had a dream about you you were in love with me and i only had eyes for you of course i had other body parts to offer you one long on in particular
لا يمكن للإنسان أبداً أن يدرك ماذا عليه أن يفعل، لأنه لا يملك إلا حياة واحدة، لا يسعه مقارنتها بِحَيوات سابقة ولا إصلاحها في حيوات لاحقة
she would have been a better fuck in greece maybe america was a shitty place to fuck
كان الحب بينه وبين تيريزا جميلاً، بكل تأكيد، ولكنه كان متعباً وجب عليه دائماً أن يخفي أمراً ما، وأن يتكتم، وأن يستدرك، وأن يرفع من معنوياتها، وأن يؤاسيها، وأن يثبت باستمرار حبه لها وأن يتلقى ملامات غيرتها وألمها وأحلامها، وأن يشعر بالذنب، وأن يبرر نفسه وأن يعتذر   الآن كل التعب تلاشى ولم تبقَ إلا الحلاوة
i had a dream about you i was a consumer and you were a consumed my grocery list had 10 items on it items 19 were cat food and the 10th item was condoms but not for sex—they were to store my leftovers as tupperware had been decreed illegal by the king
سبق لي أن قُلْتُ آنفاً إن الاستعارات خطيرة وإن الحب يبدأ من استعارة وبكلمة أُخرى الحب يبدأ في اللحظة التي تسجَّل فيها امرأة دخولها في ذاكرتنا الشعرية من خلال عبارة
إنه لمن المضحكالمبكي أن تصير أخلاقنا الحسنة بالتحديد في صالح الشرطة، والسبب أننا لم نتعلم الكذب فصيغة الأمر «قل الحقيقة» التي رسّخها آباؤها وأمهاتنا في أذهاننا، تجعلنا نشعر بطريقةٍ آلية بالعار حين نكذب حتى ولو كنا أمام الشرطي الذي يستجوبنا وإنه لأسهلَ علينا أن نتخاصم معه وأن نشتمه وهذا لا معنى له من أن نكذب عليه صراحة فيما هذا هو الأمر الوحيد الذي يجدر القيام به
i wasnt going to have dessert but it was right there all gooey and sweet  its like sex  i mean when its right there what are you supposed to do  i wasnt going to have that eithersexwith my parents bunking in the office but well it was right there ill tolerate the gooey and sweet peabody but im not thinking about you having sex with mcnab especially in the same sentence as my parents i think they had sex too eve struggled not to wince or twitch  do you want me to kick you down four flights of steps and make you walk up again id probably bounce all the way down too with all this gooey and sweet in my butt  so i guess not good choice
وسعادتهما لم تكن على الرغم من الحزن بل بفضله
i had a dream about you you were completely naked except for full body armor and i was lying on a bed trying to roll a magnum condom on a medieval sword i wanted a baby but you killed that idea
كانت التعبير عن القرف الذي تملّكها فجأة من الجنس البشري فتذكر أنها قالت له مؤخراً «صرت أشعر بالامتنان لك لأنك لم ترغب قط في إنجاب الأطفال»
كان ذلك تلميحاً إلى العبارة الموسيقية الأخيرة من رباعية بيتهوڤن الأخيرة التي تتألف من هاتين الفكرتين أليس من ذلك بدُّ؟ ليس من ذلك بدّ ولكي يكون معنى هذه الكلمات واضحاً جلياً، دوّن بيتهوڤن في مطلع العبارة الموسيقية الأخيرة الكلمات التالية «القرار الموزون بخطورة»
أثناء النهار، كانت تيريزا تحاول جاهدة لكن دون أن تتمكن فعلاً لأن تصدق ما يقوله توماس وأن تكون سعيدة كما فعلت حتى الآن غير أن الغيرة المكبوتة في النهار كانت تظهر بشكل أكثر عنفاً في أحلامها التي تنتهي دائماً بنحيب لا ينقطع إلا حين يوقظها توماس كانت أحلامها تتكرر على شكل حلقات متنوعة أو مسلسلٍ تلفزيوني ثمة حلو كان يتكرر باستمرار على سبيل المثال، وهو حلم الهررة التي تقفز إلى وجهها مُنشبة مخالبها في جلدها في الحقيقة يمكن تفسير هذا الحلم بسهولة الهرة في اللغة التشيكية كلمة عامية تعني فتاة جميلة كانت تيريزا إذاً تشعر أنها مهددة من النساء، كل النساء فالنساء كلُّهن عشيقات محتملات لتوماس ولهذا فهي تخاف منهن
in adopting a patently false but stubbornly clungto mythology of human sexuality that makes demons out of natural drives weve entered a stage of moral sickness not of moral health
من البديهي أنها لا تعي هذه الحقيقة، وهذا شيء مفهوم فالهدف الذي نلاحقه محجوب عنا دائماً   حين ترغب فتاة شابة في الزواج فهي ترغب في شيء تجهله تماماً والشاب الذي يركض وراء المجد لا يملك أدنى فكرة عن المجد لذلك، فإن الشيء الذي يعطي معنى لتصرفاتنا شيء نجهله تماماً سابينا أيضاً تجهل ما هو الهدف من رغبتها في الخيانة أيكون الهدف منها الوصول إلى الخفة غير المحتملة للكائن؟ منذ رحيلها عن جنيف وهي تقترب أكثر فأكثر من هذا الهدف
منذ ذلك الحين وكلاهما يغتبط مسبقاً بالنوم سوية وأميل تقريباً للقول بأن الهدف من الجماع بالنسبة لهما لم يكن النشوة بل النعاس الذي يعقبها وهي، خاصة، لم تكن تستطيع أن تنام من دونه لو صدف وبقيت وحيدة في شقتها الصغيرة التي لم تعد إلا مجرد خدعة كانت غير قادرة على إغماض جفن طيلة الليل أما بين ذراعيه فكانت تغفو دائماً مهما تكن درجة اضطرابها كان يروي من أجلها بصوت خافت قصصاً يبتدعها أو ترّهاتٍ وكلمات مضحكة يعيدها بلهجة رتيبة كانت هذه الكلمات تتحول في مخيّلتها إلى رؤى مشوّشة تأخذ بيدها إلى الحلم الأول كان يملك تأثيراً خارقاً على إغفائها وكانت تغفو في الدقيقة التي يقرر هو أن ينتقيها
if youre only using your bed for sleep then dont bother waking up
لم تكن الروح قادرة على إشاحة بصرها عن شائبة الولادة المستديرة السمراء فوق العانة تماماً؛ كانت الروح ترى في هذه الشائبة ختماً وسمت به الجسد، وكانت تجد  أن تحرك عضو غريب على مقربة جداً من هذا الختم المقدس، أمر فيه تجديف
if you cant have frank and honest discussions with your partner about sex youd better be damn good with your hands
i had a dream about you we made love like the trunk of a buick can hold three people that was a great idea you had hiring that videographer
فكّر توماس إن مضاجعة امرأة والنوم معها رغبتان ليستا مختلفتين فحسب بل متناقضتان أيضاً فالحب لا يتجلى بالرغبة في ممارسة الجنس وهذه الرغبة تنطبق على جملة لا تحصى من النساء ولكن بالرغبة في النوم المشترك وهذه الرغبة لا تخصّ إلا امرأة واحدة
يبدو أن في الدماغ منطقة خاصة تماماً ويمكن تسميتها بـ«الذاكرة الشعرية»، وهي التي تسجّل كل الأشياء التي سحرتنا أو التي جعلتنا ننفعل أمامها، وكل ما يعطي لحياتنا جمالها مذ تعرّف توماس إلى تيريزا، لم يعد لأي امرأة الحق في أن تترك أثراً ولو عابراً في هذه المنطقة من دماغه
love is the bodys warmth sex its heat
i had a dream about you i think we made love but i can’t be certain because the scenes were censored by the moral authorities the thing that pisses me off is my grocery list was identical to the blacklist so i was starving throughout the sequence
he swallowed and his voice was a bit rough but he was you know i think moving is key to this whole fucking thing this does t feel good gavin kissed under jamies ear while rubbing circles around his nipples with a hard palm what is this fucking for slackers
elk were mating now  the males were fighting and they had to chase the females which depleted the fat that both sexes had accumulated over the summer and thereby diminished their chances of surviving the winter  it would be better for the elk dave said as we prepared dinner if the females just gave it up all three women stared at him  a silence ensued  dave said or i could be wrong
well ive seen porn evan defends and dan just looks at him okay captain pornie walk me through it dan challenges ill be the pizza guy and jeff can be the plumber you can be  hey why dont you be the highpowered young executive evan grins at him with a glint in his eye okay fine he laces his fingers together and flexes them in front of him as if hes warming up he sits back in chair and his eyes focus on the eaves of jeffs roof then begins the young executive come home after a hard day  five pages of detailed porn  and all fall asleep together on the executives huge bed the end evan is pretty clearly proud of himself and dan really blame him after an appreciative silence dan says okay yeah so maybe theres some merit to the whole threesome thing
and sometimes theres just no point in arguing with him yeah okay me jeff and evan sitting in a tree  chris claps his hands triumphantly thats right baby than a more serious expression comes across his face but in a tree really i mean im a not an expert on the gay sex thing but i think the first time at least you should be on the ground  and then the evening continues on as expected
evan nuzzled his chin into the crook of dans neck finding the spot that always made dan squirm and laugh i love you danny you gets so fucking sappy after i let you top dan responded but he didnt move away we should stick a spigot in you drain it out and boil up some maple syrup you stick your spigot in me i wouldnt be the one topping anymore nice you freak youre the  one who wanted to make maple syrup out of my sappiness evan protested
الموسيقى بالنسبة لفرانز هي الفن الأكثر قرباً من الجمال الديونيسي الذي يقدّس النشوة يمكن لرواية أو للوحة أن تدوّخنا ولكن بصعوبة أما مع السمفونية التاسعة لبيتهوڤن، أو مع السوناتة المؤلفة من آلتيْ بيانو وآلات النقر لبارتوك، أو مع أغنية للبيتلز، فإن النشوة تعترينا من جهة أخرى فإن فرانز لا يفرّق بين الموسيقى العظيمة والموسيقى الخفيفة فهذا التفريق يبدو له خبيثاً وبالياً، فهو يحب موسيقى الروك وموزار على حد سواء الموسيقى بالنسبة له محرّرة إذ تحرره من الوحدة والانعزال ومن غبار المكتبات وتفتح في داخل جسده أبواباً لتخرج النفس وتتآخى مع الآخرين كما أنه يحب الرقص إلى جانب ذلك ويشعر بالأسى لأن سابينا لا تشاركه هذا الولع
كانت تشعر برغبة جامحة لأن تقول له كما تقول أتفه النساء «لا تتركني، احتفظ بي إلى جوارك، استعبدني، كن قوياً» ولكنها لا تستطيع ولا تعرف أن تتلفظ بمثل هذه الكلمات
يمكن اختصار مأساة حياة «باستعارة» الثقل نقول مثلاً إن حملاً قد سقط فوق أكتافنا فنحمل هذا الحمل نتحمله أو لا نتحمله ونتصارع معه، وفي النهاية إما أن نخسر وإما أن نربح ولكن ما الذي حدث مع سابينا بالضبط؟ لا شيء افترقت عن رجل لأنها كانت راغبة في الافتراق عنه هل لاحقها بعد ذلك؟ هل حاول الانتقام؟ لا فمأساتها ليست مأساة الثقل إنما مأساة الخفة والحمل الذي سقط فوقها لم يكن حملاً بل كان خفة الكائن التي لا تُطاق
ثم أردفت «هناك في المستشفى بدأت أصنّف الكتب إلى فئتين الكتب النهارية والكتب الليلية وهذا صحيح، هناك كتب للنهار وكتب أُخرى لا يمكن قراءتها إلا في الليل»
سألها ماذا بإمكانه أن يقدم لها خمر؟ لا، لا، لم تكن راغبة في الخمر  إذا كان هناك شيء ترغب في شربه، فسيكون القهوة
عندها تذكر توماس حكاية أُوديب أُوديب أيضاً لم يكن عارفاً بأنه يضاجع أمه، ومع ذلك فإنه عندما عرف بالأمر لم يجد نفسه بريئاً ولم يستطع تحمل مشهد الشقاء الذي سببه جهله ففقأ عينيه وغادر «ثيب» وهو أعمى كان توماس يسمع زعيق الشيوعيين وهم يدافعون عن براءة ذمتهم، ويفكر بسبب جهلكم فقد هذا البلد حريته لقرون عديدة مقبلة وتزعقون قائلين بأنكم أبرياء؟ كيف تجرؤون بعد على النظر حواليكم؟ كيف، ألم تصابوا بالهلع؟ أو لا عيون لديكم لتبصروا لو كانت عندكم عيون حقاً لكنتم فقأتموها وغادرتم «ثيب» كانت هذه المقارنة تروق له إلى حد أنه كان يستعملها مراراً في أحاديثه مع أصدقائه، وكان يعبّر عنها بعبارات أكثر لذعاً وأكثر فصاحة
إذا كان الهياج الجنسي آلية يتسلى بها الخالق، فإن الحب، خلافاً لذلك لا ينتمي إلا إلينا ويمكننا من خلاله الإفلات من قبضة الخالق فالحب هو حريتنا الحب هو ما وراء كل «ما ليس منه بد»
قالت «توماس، لم أعد أقدر أعرف أن لا حقّ لي في التشكي مذ رجعت إلى براغ وأنا أحظّر على نفسي الغيرة لا أريد أن أكون غيورة ولكني لا أستطيع أن أمنع نفسي عن ذلك لا قدرة لي ساعدني، أرجوك»
يعتبر تفتيش المواطنين ومراقبتهم من النشاطات الاجتماعية الأساسية والدائمة في البلدان الشيوعية فَلِكي ينال رسام حقّه في إقامة معرض أو مواطنٌ على تأشيرة لقضاء عطلته على الشاطئ، أو لكي تتم الموافقة على انضمام لاعب كرة إلى الفريق الوطني، يجب أن تجتمع أصلاً كل أنواع التقارير والشهادات التي تخصهم، شهادة الناطور وزملاء العمل والشرطة وخلية موظّفون معدّون لهذه المهمة أما ما يقال في هذه التصاريح فلا علاقة له البتة بموهبة المواطن في الرسم أو في لعب الكرة، ولا علاقة له بما إذا كانت تسمح له حالته الصحية بقضاء عطلة على الشاطئ هناك أمر واحد يهم وهو ما يسمّى «بالخلفية السياسية للمواطن» أي ماذا يقول المواطن، بماذا يفكر، كيف يتصرف، هل يشارك في الاجتماعات أو في التظاهرات في الأول من إيار وبما أن كل شيء الحياة اليومية والترقية والعطلات مرتبط بالطريقة التي يقيّمون فيها سلوك المواطن، فإن الجميع مضطرون إذاً، من أجل اللعب مع الفريق الوطني أو للتمكن من إقامة معرض، أو لقضاء عطلة على شاطئ البحر للتصرف بطريقة تجعل علاماتهم حسنة
وأن هناك أيضاً وأيضاً كواكب أخرى حيث يمكن للجنس البشري أن يلد من جديد مرتقياً في كل مرة درجةً أي حياة على سُلَّم الكمال تلك هي الفكرة التي يكوّنها توماس عن العَوْد الأبدي نحن أيضاً سكان هذه الأرض أي الكوكب رقم واحد، كوكب انعدام الخبرة، ليس في إمكاننا طبعاً إلا أن نكوّن فكرة غامضة جدًا عما سيصير بحال الإنسان في الكواكب الأخرى تُرى هل سيكون أكثر ثقلاً؟ هل سيكون الكمال في متناول يده؟ وهل سيتمكن من الوصول إليه بواسطة التكرار؟ ضمن أفق هذه اليوطوبيا وحده، يمكن لمفهومي التشاؤم والتفاؤل أن يكون لهما معنى فالمتفائل هو ذلك الذي يتصور أن التاريخ الإنساني سيكون أقل ديمومة على الكوكب رقم ٥ والمتشائم هو ذلك الذي لا يصدّق هذا الأمر
في مملكة «الكيتش» التوتاليتارية تعطى الإجابات مسبقاً محرِّمة بذلك أي سؤال جديد ينتج عن ذلك أن الإنسان الذي يتساءل هو العدو الحقيقي لـ «الكيتش» السؤال هو مثل مسكين يمزق القماشة المرسومة للديكور فيصبح في المستطاع رؤية ما يختبئ خلفها هكذا شرحت سابينا لتيريزا معنى لوحاتها من الأمام الكذب الصارخ، ومن الخلف الحقيقة التي لا يُدرك كنهها إلا أن هؤلاء الذين يناضلون ضد  الأنظمة المسمّاة توتاليتارية قلَّما يمكنهم النضال من خلال أسئلة وشكوك فهُم أيضاً بحاجة إلى قناعتهم وإلى حقيقتهم البسيطة التي يفترض أن يفهمها أكبر عدد ممكن من الناس وأن تحدث إفرازاً دمْعياً جماعياً
تذكر عندها أسطورة أفلاطون الشهيرة «المأدبة» ففي السابق كان البشر مزدوجي الجنس فقسّمهم الله إلى أنصاف تهيم عبر العالم مفتشة بعضها عن بعض الحب هو تلك الرغبة في إيجاد النصف الآخر المفقود من أنفسنا
في سفر التكوين، عهد الله إلى الإنسان بالسيادة على الحيوانات وبإمكاننا أن نفسر ذلك قائلين إن الله قد أعار هذه السلطة له الإنسان ليس مالك الكوكب بل وكيله وعليه ذات يوم أن يقدم كشفاً لحسابه ديكارت ذهب أبعد من ذلك في هذا المنحى جعل الإنسان «سيد الطبيعة ومالكها» وهو منطقي جداً بالتأكيد فيما يتعلق بنفيه لوجود الروح عند الحيوانات فحسب ما يقول ديكارت، الإنسان هو المالك والسيد فيما الحيوان ليس إلا مسيّراً وآلة حية، أو ما يمسيه بال «ماشيناأنيماتا» عندما يئن الحيوان فالأمر لا يتعلق بشكوى بل بصرير تطلقه آلة تسير بشكل سيئ فحين تئز عجلة عربة فهذا لا يعني أن العربة تتألم بل لأنها تحتاج إلى تشحيم وبالطريقة ذاتها يجب أن يُفسّر نحيب الحيوان ويجب ألا نشفق على كلب يُشرَّح وهو حيّ في مختبر
ماذا بقي من محتضري كمبوديا؟ صورة كبيرة للنجمة الأميركية تحمل بين ذراعيها طفلاً أصفر ماذا بقي من توماس؟ كتابةُ أراد مملكة الله على الأرض ماذا بقي من بيتهوڤن؟ رجل مقطب الوجه، مشعث الشعر كمجنون وينطق بصوت مكتئب «esmuss sein» «ليس من ذلك بدّ» ماذا بقي من فرانز؟ كتابةُ بعد طول ضلال، العودة وهكذا دواليك، وهكذا دواليك قبل أن نُنسَى نتحول إلى «كيتش» «الكيتش» هو محطة اتصال بين الكائن والنسيان
جاء في بداية سفر التكوين أن الله خلق الإنسان وجعله يتسلط على الطيور والأسماك والماشية بطبيعة الحال، الحق في سفك دم أيّلٍ أو بقرة هو الشيء الوحيد الذي اتفقت عليه الإنسانية جمعاء بتآخٍ حتى خلال الحروب الأكثر دموية قد يبدو لنا هذا الحق بديهياً لأننا نعتبر أنفسنا في قمة السلم ولكن يكفي أن يتدخل شخص شخص ثالث في اللعبة، زائر آتٍ مثلاً من كوكب آخر وقد أمره الله «سوف تكون لك سلطة على كائنات الكواكب الأخرى كافة»، فتصبح عندئذ بداهة التكوين موضع شك في الحال
كانت تخاف من أن يُغلق عليها داخل نعش وأن تُدلَّى في أرض أميركا لذلك كتبت وصية اشترطت فيها أن تُحرق جثتها بعد موتها، وأن يُنثر رمادها في الهواء تيريزا وتوماس ماتا تحت شعار الثقل أما هي فأرادت أن تموت تحت شعار الخفة سوف تصير أخف من الهواء وحسب رأي بارمينيد، فإن موتها تحوّل من السلبي إلى الإيجابي
الحنين إلى الجنة إذاً هو رغبة الإنسان في ألًا يكون إنساناً
تجاوزت مدة التمثيلية المرتجلة الحدود كان فرانز يجد أن هذه الملهاة التي كان يقرّ بأنها ساحرة على كل حال قد طالت أكثر من اللازم فأمسك القبعة الرجالية بين أصبعيه وانتزعها عن رأس سابينا وهو يبتسم، ثم علقها فوق القاعدة  كان الأمر كمن يمحو شاربين رسمهما ولد عفريت على صورة مريم العذراء
بإمكان الكوكب أن يتهاوى على أثر تفجير القنابل ويمكن للوطن أن ينهبه كل يوم مختلس جديد، ويمكن لسكان الحي جميعهم أن يُساقوا إلى كتيبة الإعدام يمكنه أن يتحمل كل هذا بسهولة أكبر مما يجرؤ على القول، ولكنه غير قادر على تحمل الحزن الذي يسببه حلم واحد من أحلام تيريزا
عادت تيريزا إلى النوم من جديد ولكنه هو لم يستطع النوم كان يتخيلها ميتة وترى أحلاماً رهيبة ولم يكن في استطاعته إيقاظها لأنها ميتة نعم، هذا هو الموت أن تنام تيريزا وترى أحلاماً فظيعة دون أن يتمكن من إيقاظها
الخيانة منذ طفولتنا والوالد ومعلم المدرسة يكرران على مسامعنا بأنها أفظع شيء في الوجود
لا أحد يعرف ذلك بصورة أفضل مما يعرف السياسيون فما أن يروا آلة تصوير على مقربة منهم حتى يهبُّوا راكضين إثر أول طفل يصادفونه فيحملونه في أذرعتهم ويقبلونه في خده «الكيتش» هو المثال الأعلى لكل السياسيين ولكل الحركات السياسية
كان يخشى في أغلب الأحيان أن يجدها جالسة على أرض الدكان الذي تشتري منه السجائر
هل صحيح أنه يجب علينا أن نرفع صوتنا حين يُسكت أحدهم رجلاً؟ نعم
ينتج عن ذلك أن الوفاق التام مع الكائن يتخذ مثاله الأعلى عالماً يُنتفى منه البراز، ويتصرف كل واحد فيه وكأن البراز غير موجود هذا المثال الجمالي يدعى «الكيتش» «كيتش» هي كلمة ألمانية ظهرت في أواسط القرن التاسع عشر العاطفي، ثم انتشرت بعد ذلك في جميع اللغات ولكن استعمالها بكثرة أزال دلالتها الميتافيزيقية الأصلية وهي كلمة كيتش في الأساس نفي مطلق للبراز وبالمعنى الحرفي كما بالمعنى المجازي «الكيتش» تطرح جانباً كل ما هو غير مقبول في الوجود الإنساني
في مجتمع تتعايش فيه تيارات شتّى وحيث يمكن لتأثير هذه التيارات أن يُمحى أو يحدّ بشكل متناوب، يبقى في المستطاع الإفلات تقريباً من محاكم «الكيتش» ويمكن للفرد عندئذ أن يحافظ على تميزه، وللفنان أن يخلق أعمالاً فنيّة مدهشة ولكن في البلدان التي يستأثر فيها حزب سياسي بالسلطة كلها، نجد أنفسنا حالاً في مملكة «الكيتش» الدكتاتورية إذا كنت أقول ديكتاتورية فإني أقصد بذلك أن كل ما يطعن بـ «الكيتش» ملغىً من الحياة كل إظهار للفردية، لأن أي نشاز هو بصفة في وجه الأخوّة الباسمة وكلّ شك لأن من يبدأ بالشك في التفاصيل الصغيرة يتوصل في نهاية المطاف لأن يشك في الحياة بحد ذاتها كذلك السخرية لأن كل شيء في مملكة «الكيتش» يؤخذ على محمل الجد، وأيضاً الأم التي هجرت عائلتها، أو الرجل الذي يفضّل الرجال على النساء مهدداً بذلك الشعار المقدس «تناسلو واملاؤا الأرض» انطلاقاً من وجهة النظر هذه، فإن ما يسمى بـ «الغولاغ» يمكن اعتباره ثغرة عفنة يرمي فيها «الكيتش» التوتاليتاري بأوساخه
البراز إذاً هو مسألة لاهوتية أكثر صعوبة من مسألة الشر فالله قد أعطى الحرية للإنسان وبذلك يمكننا أن نسلّم بأن الله ليس مسؤولاً عن جرائم البشر
كانت القبعة تصير إذاً لازمة موسيقية في المقطوعة التي هي حياة سابينا كانت هذه اللازمة تتكرر دائماً وأبداً آخذة في كل مرة معنى جديداً وكانت هذه المعاني تمر كلها عبر القبعة الرجالية كما يمر الماء في مجرى النهر وأستطيع القول إن مجرى النهر هذا مشابه لمجرى نهر هيراقليط «إننا لا نستحم مرتين في النهر نفسه» كانت سابينا ترى أن القبعة الرجالية مجرى نهر يسيل فيه كل مرة نهر آخر، نهر «لغوي آخر»، حيث يثير الشيئ نفسه كل مرة معنى جديداً، ولكن هذا المعنى الجديد كان يرجّع مثل صدىً أو موكب أصداء كل المعاني السابقة   فتظنُّ حينها كل تجربة جديدة معيوشة بإيقاع أكثر غنى
تُرى كيف كان هذا ممكناً؟ قبل ذلك بقليل كانت القبعة التي تضعها على رأسها تهمُّ بأن تكون مجرد مزحة ماذا ألا تفصل المضحك عن المثير غير خطوة واحدة؟
عندما كان سيمون يفكر في ذلك اللقاء كان يشعر بالخجل من وَهَله من المؤكد أنه لم يُعجب أباه أما هو فأُعجب بأبيه كان يتذكر كل كلمة تفوّه بها مستصوباً مواقفه أكثر فأكثر هناك جملة على الأخص علقت بذاكرته «إدانة هؤلاء الذين لا يعرفون ماذا يفعلون، عمل بربري» وعندما وضع عمّ صديقته كتاب التوراة بين يديه، تأثر بكلمات يسوع التي تقول «إغفر لهم لأنهم لا يدرون ماذا يفعلون» كان يعرف أن أباه ملحد ولكن التشابه بين الجملتين كان بالنسبة له وكأنه رمز خفي يعني أن أباه يستحسن الطريق التي اختارها

من يبغي «الارتقاء» باستمرار، عليه أن يستعد يوماً للإصابة بالدوار لكن ما هو الدوار؟ أهو الخوف من السقوط؟ ولكن لماذا نصاب بالدوار على شرفة السطح حتى ولو كانت مزودة بدرابزين متين؟ ذلك أن الدوار شيء مختلف عن الخوف من السقوط إنه صوت الفراغ ينادينا من الأسفل فيجذبنا ويفتننا إنه الرغبة في السقوط التي نقاومها فيما بعد وقت أصابتنا الذعر

لم يكن صراخها لهاثاً ولم يكن تأوّهاً، بل صراخ حقيقي كانت تصرخ بصوت عالٍ إلى درجة أن توماس أبعد رأسه عن وجهها وكأن صوتها الزاعق سيثقب طبلة أذنه لم يكن هذا الصراخ تعبيراً عن الشبق فالشبق هو التعبئة القصوى للحواس نراقب الآخر بانتباه بالغ ونسمع أدنى أصواته لكن صراخ تيريزا كان بخلاف ذلك، يريد أن يُرهق الحواس ويمنعها من الرؤية والسمع كانت المثالية الساذجة لحبّها هي التي تزعق في داخلها راغبة في إلغاء كل التناقضات، وفي إلغاء ثنائية الروح والجسد، وحتّى في إلغاء الزمن

زد على ذلك أن هذه الأحلام، إلى فصاحتها، كانت جميلة لقد أغفل فرويد هذا الجانب في نظريته عن الأحلام فالحلم ليس فقط بلاغاً بلاغاً مرموزاً عند الاقتضاء بل هو أيضاً نشاط جمالي ولعبة للخيال وهذه اللعبة هي بحد ذاتها قيمة فالحلم هو البرهان على أن التخيل وتصوّر ما ليس له وجود، هو إحدى الحاجات الأساسية للإنسان، وهنا يكمن أصل الخطر الخادع الكامن في الحلم فلو أن الحلم ليس جميلاً، لأمكننا نسيانه بسهولة لذلك، كانت تيريزا ترجع باستمرار إلى أحلامها وتعيدها في مخيلتها وتختلق منها أساطير أمّا توماس فكان يعيش في كنف السحر المنوّم، سحر الجمال الأليم لأحلام تيريزا
كان بإمكان آنّا أن تنهي حياتها بطريقة أخرى مختلفة تماماً ولكن حافز المحطة والموت، هذا الحافز الذي لا يُنسى لاقترانه ببداية الحب، كان يجذبها في لحظات اليأس، بجماله القائم فالإنسان ينسج حياته على غير علم منه وفقاً لقوانين الجمال حتى في لحظات اليأس الأكثر قتامة لا يمكن إذاً أن يأخذ أحد على رواية افتتانها بالاتفاق الغامض للصدف مثلاً، تلاقي فرونسكي وآنّـا والرصيف والموت أو تلاقي بيتهوڤن وتوماس وتيريزا وكأس الكونياك لكن يمكن أن يؤخذ بِحقٍّ على الإنسان حين يُعمي عينيه عن هذه الصدفْ فيحرم بالتالي حياته من بُعد الجمال

فهي لم تكن تملك  في مقابلة عالم التفاهة الذي يحيط بها، إلا سلاحاً واحداً الكتب التي تستعيرها من مكتبة البلدية وخصوصاً الروايات كانت تقرأ أكداساً منها، ابتداءً بفيلدنغ وانتهاءً بتوماس مان كانت هذه الروايات تمنحها فرصة للهروب الخيالي، وتقتلعها من حياة لم تكن تعطيها أي شعور بالاكتفاء لكنها كانت أيضاً تعني لها بصفتها أدوات كانت تحب أن تتنزه وهي تتأبط كتباً كانت تميّزها عن الآخرين مثلما كانت العصا تميز المتأنق في القرن الفائت المقارنة بين الكتاب وعصا المتأنق ليست صحيحة تماماً فالعصا التي تميّر المتأنق كانت تجعل منه شخصاً عصرياً و «على الموضة» أمّا الكتاب الذي يميّز تيريزا عن النساء الأخريات فيجعلها خارج زمانها كانت طبعاً أكثر شباباً من أن تفهم ما هو «قديم الزي» في شخصيتها كانت تجد المراهقين الذين يتنزهون حولها حاملين ترانزستوارت زاعقة، بُلهاء، ولم يكن يخطر في بالها أنهم عصريون

لقاءه بتيريزا كان حصيلة صدف ست بعيدة الاحتمال لكن، خلافاً لذلك أفلا تقاس أهمية حدث، وكثرة معانيه بارتباطه بأكبر عدد ممكن من الصدف؟ وحدها الصدفة يمكن أن تكون ذات مغزى فما يحدث بالضرورة، ما هو متوقع ويتكرر يومياً يبقى شيئاً أبكم وحدها الصدفة ناطقة نسعى لأن نقرأ فيها كما يقرأ الغجريون في الرسوم التي يخطها ثفل القهوة في مقر الفنجان

frosh 2002 has suggested that therapeutic spaces provide children and adults with the rare opportunity to articulate experiences that are otherwise excluded from the dominant symbolic order however since the 1990s postmodern and poststructural theory has often been deployed in ways that attempt to ‘manage’ from afar the perturbing disclosures of abuse and trauma that arise in therapeutic spaces frosh 2002 nowhere is this clearer than in relation to organised abuse where the testimony of girls and women has been deconstructed as symptoms of cultural hysteria showalter 1997 and the colonisation of women’s minds by therapeutic discourse hacking 1995 however behind words and discourse ‘a real world and real lives do exist howsoever we interpret construct and recycle accounts of these by a variety of symbolic means’ stanley 1993 214 summit 1994 5 once described organised abuse as a ‘subject of smoke and mirrors’ observing the ways in which it has persistently defied conceptualisation or explanation explanations for serious or sadistic child sex offending have typically rested on psychiatric concepts of ‘paedophilia’ or particular psychological categories that have limited utility for the study of the cultures of sexual abuse that emerge in the families or institutions in which organised abuse takes pace for those clinicians and researchers who take organised abuse seriously their reliance upon individualistic rather than sociological explanations for child sexual abuse has left them unable to explain the emergence of coordinated and often sadistic multi—perpetrator sexual abuse in a range of contexts around the world

the data on organised abuse has been simplified or distorted in an attempt force it to conform to mechanical psychological models of dissociative obedience or else to the psychiatric framework of ‘paedophilia’ psychopathology alone is an inadequate explanation for environments in which sexual abuse has a social and symbolic function for groups of adults abusive groups do not emerge in a vacuum but rather they are formed within preexisting social arrangements such as families churches and schools

like the psychological model outlined above the psychiatric understanding of ’organised paedophilia’ is a framework that is focused primarily on individual psychological factors and overlooks the role of violence in criminal groups and the contexts in which such groups emerge the underlying assumption of literature on ‘organised paedophilia’ is that members of sexually abusive groups are motivated by a pathological sexual interest in children but this does not accord with evidence that suggests that abusive groups can simultaneously abuse children and women it is increasingly recognised that sexual offenders may not specialise in one particular victim category and a significant proportion of child sexual  abusers have also offended against adults cann et al 2007 heil et al 2003 furthermore many of the behaviours of abusive groups appear to be designed to elicit fear and pain from the victim rather than to generate sexual pleasure for the perpetrator per se are not mutually exclusive but there is a sadistic dimension to organised abuse that is not explicable as ‘paedophilic’ a survivor of organised abuse from belgium regina louf made this point clearly when she said i find the expression ‘paedophile network’ misleading for me paedophiles are those men who go to playgrounds or swimming pools priests…i certainly dont want to exonerate them but i would rather have paedophiles than the types we were involved with there were men who never touched the children whether you were five ten or fifteen didn’t matter what mattered to them was sex power experience to do things they would never have tried with their own wives among them were some real sadists louf quoted in bulte and de conick 1998 a credible theoretical account of organised abuse must necessarily a account for the available empirical evidence of organised abuse b address the complex patterns of abuse and violence evident in sexually abusive groups and c explain the ways in which sexually abusive groups form in a range of contexts including families and institutions
there are a range of useful and illuminating analyses of the media construction of organised abuse as it became frontpage news in the 1980s and 1990s kitzinger 2004 atmore 1997 kelly 1998 but this book is focused on organised abuse as a criminal practice as well as a discursive object of study debate and disagreement these two dimensions of this topic are inextricably linked because precisely where and how organised abuse is reported to take place is an important determinant of how it is understood prior to the 1980s the predominant view of the police psychiatrists and other authoritative professionals was that organised abuse occurred primarily outside the family where it was committed by extrafamilial ‘paedophiles’ this conceptualisation of organised abuse has received enduring community support to the present day where concerns over children’s safety is often framed in terms of their vulnerability to manipulation by ‘paedophiles’ and ‘sex rings’ this view dovetails more generally with the medicolegal and media construction of the ‘paedophile as an external threat to the sanctity of the family and community cowburn and dominelli 2001 but it is confounded by evidence that organised abuse and other forms of serious sexual abuse often originates in the home or in institutions such as schools and churches where adults have socially legitimate authority over children

as mandatory reporting laws and community awareness drove an increase its child protection investigations throughout the 1980s some children began to disclose premeditated sadistic and organised abuse by their parents relatives and other caregivers such as priests and teachers hechler 1988 adults in psychotherapy described similar experiences the dichotomies that had previously associated organised abuse with the dangerous external ‘other’ had been breached and the incendiary debate that followed is an illustration of the depth of the collective desire to see them restored campbell 1988 noted the paradox that whilst journalists and politicians often demand that the authorities respond more decisively in response to a ‘crisis’ of sexual abuse the action that is taken is then subsequently construed as a ‘crisis’ there has been a particularly pronounced tendency of the public reception to allegations of organised abuse the removal of children from their parents due to disclosures of organised abuse the provision of mental health care to survivors of organised abuse police investigations of allegations of organised abuse and the prosecution of alleged perpetrators of organised abuse have all generated their own controversies these were disagreements that were cloaked in the vocabulary of science and objectivity but nonetheless were played out in sensationalised fashion on primetime television glossy news magazines and populist books drawing textual analysis the role of therapy and social work in the construction of testimony of abuse and trauma in particular has come under sustained postmodern attack frosh 2002 has suggested that therapeutic spaces provide children and adults with the rare opportunity to articulate experiences that are otherwise excluded from the dominant symbolic order however since the 1990s postmodern and poststructural theory has often been deployed in ways that attempt to ‘manage’ from afar the perturbing disclosures of abuse and trauma that arise in therapeutic spaces frosh 2002 nowhere is this clearer than in relation to organised abuse where the testimony of girls and women has been deconstructed as symptoms of cultural hysteria showalter 1997 and the colonisation of women’s minds by therapeutic discourse hacking 1995 however behind words and discourse ‘a real world and real lives do exist howsoever we interpret construct and recycle accounts of these by a variety of symbolic means’ stanley 1993 214 summit 1994 5 once described organised abuse as a ‘subject of smoke and mirrors’ observing the ways in which it has persistently defied conceptualisation or explanation

it galls me that seeking out the seedy the sordid the sexual and the deviant is the expected if not altogether acceptable behavior of male writers it would surely benefit me as a writer if i had the courage to seek out more of the seedy the sordid the sexual and the deviant myself but women who seek out such things are made to feel ashamed or else they sound stridently ridiculous in defending themselves  as if theyre bragging   yet there are subjects that remain offlimits for women writers its not unlike that dichotomy which exists regarding ones sexual past it is permissible even attractive for a man to have had one but if a woman has had a sexual past shed better keep quiet about it

it should not be a surprise to find that sm fantasy is significant in womens sex lives women may be born free but they are born into a system of subordination we are not born into equality and do not have equality to eroticise we are not born into power and do not have power to eroticise we are born into subordination and it is in subordination that we learn our sexual and emotional responses it would be surprising indeed if any woman reared under male supremacy was able to escape the forces constructing her into a member of an inferior slave class

i remember the very day sometime during the first two weeks of my fiveyear amorous sojourn in brutland when i was made privy to one of the most arcane of their utterings the time was ripe for that major epiphany my initiation into the sacred knowledge—or should i say gnosis—of that allimportant quintessentially brutish slang term the word that endless hours of scholastic education by renowned mentors plus years of scrupulous scrutiny into scrofulous texts had disappointingly failed to impart to me leaving me with that deep sense of emptiness begotten by hemimathy the time was finally ripe for me to be transported by the velvety feel of the unvoiced palatoalveolar fricative the élan of the unpronounceable and masochistically hedonistic front openrounded vowel and last but not least the admittedly short ejaculatory quality of the voiced velar stop all three of them combined together to form that miraculous lexical item the word shag

elsie who had a lot of energy and no shame she seduced me  it was not a success from elsies point of view because the orgasm for women was just coming into general popularity then and she didnt have one

his passion she had expected even his expertise for a man of his years would not have been without women  she had even in the long days of yearning suspected his tenderness which led him now to kiss her temples and the inner crook of her elbow with the same attention he gave to her lips and breasts what she had not anticipated was that he would be vulnerable as well
love is a banana first you peel it and then you roll on the condom
sex is sharing you see and its good to share with everyone but the sharing has to be real and meaningful that creates problems
i’m positive i wouldn’t consider having sex with guy if i hadn’t already had sex beforehand i always knew i wanted my first time to be with someone i loved and who loved me which it was    but shouldn’t i want that for every time i disagree with what amy said about how once you go all the way you can’t go back to everything but but now that i have done it it doesn’t seem nearly as big a deal to do it again

listen to your lover or babe sweetie cakes hot rod honey dancing queen dairy queen etc if she tells you she likes it when you bite her neck—do it it doesn’t matter where she learned that she likes it or why she does just be thankful you got the tip girls don’t always express what they want so when she does say it you really want to make sure you are paying attention also learn her language unless it is mandarin because that shit is impossible if you start pulling her hair and she starts moaning that’s her way of saying ohmygod please do this more and by more i mean all the time and the more you please her the more she’ll want to do it with you it’s a winwin

you see there was this man and he was a good man he worked hard and did everything to the best of his ability  all he desired was for the most beautiful woman in the kingdom to be his wife  now this wasnt all bad because she actually loved him toovery much sobut this vizier he wanted her as well and not for so noble a cause as love what did he want her for yashar paused for a  moment  so that people could look at him and say he must be a great man to have such a beautiful wife oh  i thought he wanted her for sex said colby disappointed

and even though they had not had sex yet he was a great lover replacing sex with the science of bravery and inner strength meredith had always wanted a man with this kind of depth
i dont know the ethics  but some times sex is at highest priority in a relationship
but let me just say that talking dirty is so important in sex and it’s pretty easy to wit establish from the very beginning that you like this and trust me you want to do it early on because if you wait too long to introduce the concept your special lady friend will be a little thrown and might not take you seriously think of it as a hat if you never ever wear a hat and one day you try to rock a fedora with a feather all of your friends will be like dude—why are you wearing a fucking fedora with a fucking feather you’ll feel insecure and never wear it again now imagine that scenario but in bed with your hardened dick out and it’s your girlfriend saying dude—why the fuck are you talking like that not good

a teen boys wet dream right here right in front of him  elliott closed his eyes trying to reason with his raging erection which argued come on come on its been fifty years
just because the sexes are equal doesn’t mean that sex is
the human erotic imagination is a vast wilderness of sexual possibilities we are each capable of enjoying a pleasurable satisfying and potentially ecstatic sex life yet our culture encourages us to keep the window of possibility very narrow limiting our erotic expression to a short list of approved activities and energies to truly experience sexual freedom you must reclaim your erotic imagination and allow yourself to make your sex life a work of art your very own creation designed to fulfill your unique needs and desires
but when i gave bl0w jobs to my ex i secretly hated it what’s pleasant about sucking on a stiff veiny appendage that spurts pee and sperm
it feels as though tonys a ghost a wisp of someone i once loved or never loved at all and thought was someone else  i dont feel anything not even when he fucks me  i wonder if he knows  i wonder if he believes i still want him  i always tell myself its the last time but i dont leave  i exist instead inside this shell of a life weve created
woman enjoy sex more than a man because they dont precompile every pleasure in their mind
the other big con is whether having sex could cause me to more than just like like guy but that could happen even if we don’t sleep together you don’t even need to date a boy to dream about marrying him
i make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep
making love to me is amazing wait i meant making love to me is amazing the absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god

let me give you some advice here people who want to have the sex talk with you will act the same way as people who want to murder you first they get you in their car so theyre in control and you cant escape then they drive you someplace in the middle of nowhere
of all the various kinds of sexual intercourse this has the least to recommend it  as an amusement it is too fleeting as an occupation it is too wearing as a public exhibition there is no money in it  it is unsuited to the drawing room and in the most cultured society it has long been banished from the social board it has at last in our day of progress and improvement been degraded to brotherhood with flatulence among the best bred these two arts are now indulged in only privatethough by consent of the whole company when only males are present it is still permissible in good society to remove the embargo on the fundamental sigh

i had always believed and not only out of cynicism that a man and a woman could tell in the first ten minutes whether they wanted to go to bed together and that the time that passed after those first ten minutes represented a tax which might be worth paying if the article promised to be really enjoyable but which nine times out of ten became rapidly excessive

typically one of the arguments against the ethicalness of chemical castration is that it affects the very core of personhood part of which is sexual drive and sexual fantasizing by indirectly acting on the cns … but i think an equally good argument could be that it interferes with basic homeostatic processes of the organism regulated by the autonomic pns and the endocrine system maybe the public tends to agree with chemical castration of sexual offenders especially of pedophiles not only because of the terrible acts they have committed but also because there is a hidden prejudice that the real or genuine person of such offenders is a mind that has been captured by hormones and that there is nothing wrong in killing off these hormones and liberate the person from their vicious influence … i say it is a prejudice because part of what it means to be a mentally healthy and well adapted individual involves a huge influence of the hormonal component not only testosterone but all other hormones and as a matter of fact sexual offenders do not have abnormally high levels of free testosterone
there is lovemaking that is bad for a person just as there is eating that is bad that boysenberry cream pie from the thrifte mart may appear inviting may in fact cause all nine hundred taste buds to carol from the tongue but in the end the sugars the additives the empty calories clog arteries disrupt cells generate fat and rot teeth even potentially nourishing foods can be improperly prepared there are wrong combinations and improper preparations in sex as well yes one must prepare for a fuckthe way an enlightened priest prepares to celebrate mass the way a great matador prepares for the ring with intensification with purification with a conscious summoning of sacred power and even that wont work if the ingredients are poorly matched oysters are delectable so are strawberries but mashed together    every nutritious sexual recipe calls for at least a pinch of love and the fucks that rate fourstar rankings from both gourmets and healthfood nuts use cupfuls not that sex should be regarded as therapeutic or to be taken for medicinal purposesonly a dullard would hang such a millstone around the nibbled neck of a laybut to approach sex carelessly shallowly with detachment and without warmth is to dine night after night in erotic greasy spoons in time ones palate will become insensitive one will suffer without knowing it emotional malnutrition the skin of the soul will fester with scurvy the teeth of the heart will decay neither duration nor proclamation of commitment is necessarily the measurethere are ephemeral explosions of passion between strangers that make more erotic sense than lengthy marriages there are onenight stands in jersey city more glorious than sixmonths affairs in parisbut finally there is a commitment however brief a purity however threatened a vulnerability however concealed a generosity of spirit however marbled with need and honest caring  however singled by lust that must be present if couplings are to be salubrious and not slow poison
at least you died and went to heaven
but sex that was the opposite of control there were emotions and attraction and that pesky other person that just had to be involved not my idea of fun

men and the pursuit of them are strongly intertwined with my mental health i would say in my defensive defense that the problem with being a serial monogamist is there isnt anybody random or unimportant everybody you sleep with really means something which is to say each of them is on your public record at some point i wake up thinking fuck this i dont want another man in my bed ever again what i really want is a cat

in the middle of the night he woke up and realized to his surprise that he had been having one erotic dream after the other the only one he could recall with any clarity was the last an enormous naked woman at least five times his size floating on her back in a pool her belly from crotch to navel covered with thick hair looking at her from the side of the pool he was greatly excited how could he have been excited when his body was debilitated by a gastric disorder and how could he be excited by the sight of a woman who would have repelled him had he seen her while conscious he thought in the clockwork of the head two cogwheels turn opposite each other on the one images on the other the bodys reactions the cog carrying the image of a naked woman meshes with the corresponding erectioncommand cog but when for one reason or another the wheels go out of phase and the excitement cog meshes with a cog bearing the image of a swallow in flight the penis rises at the sight of a swallow moreover a study by one of tomass colleagues a specialist in human sleep claimed that during any kind of dream men have erections which means that the link between erections and naked women is only one of a thousand ways the creator can set the clockwork moving in a mans head and what has love in common with all this nothing if a cogwheel in tomass head goes out of phase and he is excited by seeing a swallow it has absolutely no effect on his love for tereza if excitement is a mechanism our creator uses for his own amusement love is something that belongs to us alone and enables us to flee the creator love is our freedom love lies beyond es muss sein though that is not entirely true even if love is something other than a clockwork of sex that the creator uses for his own amusement it is still attached to it it is attached to it like a tender naked woman to the pendulum of an enormous clock thomas thought attaching love to sex is one of the most bizarre ideas the creator ever had he also thought one way of saving love from the stupidity of sex would be to set the clockwork in our head in such a way as to excite us at the sight of a swallow and with that sweet thought he started dozing off but on the very threshold of sleep in the nomansland of muddled concepts he was suddenly certain he had just discovered the solution to all riddles the key to all mysteries a new utopia a paradise a world where man is excited by seeing a swallow and tomas can love tereza without being disturbed by the aggressive stupidity of sex

in actuality there are no such things as male or female hormones hormones have no sex of their own and all types of sex hormones are present in all human beings in varying amounts
trite though it used to sound real sexuality is about our struggles to connect with one another to erect bridges across the chasms that separate selves sexuality is finally about imagination thanks to brave peoples recognition of aids as a fact of life we are beginning to realize that highly charged sex can take place in all sorts of ways wed forgotten or neglected—in a conversational nuance in a bodys posture a certain pressure in a held hand sex can be everywhere we are all the time

for hitschmann and bergler frigidity had a single criterion absence of the vaginal orgasm the standard was unqualified and absolute a woman who did not enjoy intercourse frigid women who derived sexual pleasure from acts other than intecourse were frigid too nothing else mattered only whether a woman had an orgasm because a mans penis was inside her vagina sexually agressive women were labeled frigid because of the association between masculinity and aggressiveness womanhood that was not passive was not properly womanly frigidity as jane gerhardt points out thus became a label and a diagnosis that defined how much sexual desire a woman must have and in what kinds of sexual behavior she must engage to be healthy

i mean i am totally not one of those prudes who believe having sex as a teenager is some kind of mortal sin or social death i dont have a problem with sex i just dont happen to be having it and if i were having sex i certainly wouldnt be getting it on in an airplane bathroom  who wants to get down and dirty in a place so    cramped and dirty
chase tugged my hips flush against his and i felt a hard length between us it was only a bulge against the leather of his pants but it was enough to get me wetter than a rainforest between my legs
and that is why i consider promiscuity immoral not because sex is evil but because sex is too good and too important  what sex should involve is a very serious relationship whether that relationship should or should not become a marriage is a question which depends on the circumstances and the context of the two persons lives i consider marriage a very important institution but it is important when and if two people have found the person with whom they wish to spend the rest of their lives  a question of which no man or woman can be automatically certain when one is certain that ones choice is final then marriage is of course a desirable state but this does not mean that any relationship based on less than total certainty is improper i think the question of an affair or a marriage depends on the knowledge and the position of the two persons involved and should be left up to them either is moral provided only that both parties take the relationship seriously and that it is based on values
if this were a different time a different place i would take you to bed with me and make love to you for days he said his voice slow and deep and intent i would use my mouth on you until no part of your skin went untouched and i would make you come over and over again until you could stand no more and then id let you sleep in my arms until you were rested and then i would start all over again i would kiss your wounds i would drink your tears i could make love to you in ways that havent even been invented yet i would make love to you in fields of flowers and under starry skies where there is no death or pain or sorrow i would show you things you havent even dreamed of and there would be no one in the world but you and me between your legs in your mouth everywhere

the church though has always held up a mirror in which society can see reflected some of its uglier aspects and it does not like what it sees thus it becomes angry but not as it should be with itself but with the church this is particularly noticeable when it comes to issues of personal gratification and sexuality and especially apart from abortion when issues of artificial contraception condoms and the birthcontrol pill are discussed the church warned in the 1960s that far from creating a more peaceful content and sexually fulfilled society the universal availability of the pill and condoms would lead to the direct opposite in the decade since we have seen a seemingly inexorable increase in sexually transmitted diseases socalled unwanted pregnancies sexualityrelated depression divorce family breakdown pornography addiction and general unhappiness in the field of sexual relationships the churchs argument was that far from liberating women contraception would enable and empower men and reduce the value and dignity of sexuality to the point of transforming what should be a loving and profound act into a mere exchange of bodily fluids the expunging from the sexual act the possibility of procreation the church said would reduce sexuality to mere selfgratification pleasure was vital and godgiven but there was also a purpose a glorious purpose to sex that went far beyond the merely instant and ultimately selfish
i hope you nail the bastard so does he
just as sex is a godgiven instinct for the prolongation of the human race so the desire for property as a prolongation of ones ego is a natural right sanctioned by natural law a person is free on the inside because he can call his soul his own he is free on the outside because he can call property his own internal freedom is based upon the fact that i am external freedom is based on the fact that i have but just as the excesses of flesh produce lust for lust is sex in the wrong place so there can be a deordination of the desire for property until it becomes greed avarice and capitalistic aggression

in irena’s head the alcohol plays a double role it frees her fantasy encourages her boldness makes her sensual and at the same time it dims her memory she makes love wildly lasciviously and at the same time the curtain of oblivion wraps her lewdness in an allconcealing darkness as if a poet were writing his greatest poem with ink that instantly disappears

love is a renewable resource
i don’t think that loneliness is necessarily a bad or unconstructive condition my own skill at jamming time may actually be dependent on some fluid mixture of emotions among them curiosity sexual desire and love all suspended in a solvent medium of loneliness i like the heroes or heroines of books i read to be living alone and feeling lonely because reading is itself a state of artificially enhanced loneliness loneliness makes you consider other people’s lives makes you more polite to those you deal with in passing dampens irony and cynicism the interior of the fold is of course the place of ultimate loneliness and i like it there but there are times when the wish for others’ voices for friendliness returned reaches unpleasant levels and becomes a kind of immobilizing pain that was how it felt as i finished packing up the box of sex machines
arousal begins within the mind then seeps out where fantasy propels physicality
cain considers life and can find no explanation for it there is that woman who although clearly sick with desire is enjoying postponing the moment of surrender which is not at all the right word because lilith when she does finally open her legs to allow herself to be penetrated will not be surrendering but trying to devour the man to whom she said enter

the hotness of a sex scene lies in the loins of the beholder
i admire nudity and i like sex and so did a lot of people in the thirties but to me overexposure blunts the fun…sex as something beautiful may soon disappear once it was a knife so finely honed the edge was invisible until it was touched and then it cut deep now it is so blunt that it merely bruises and leaves ugly marks nudity is fine in the privacy of my own bedroom with the appropriate partner or for a model in life class at art school or as portrayed in stone and paint but i don’t like it used as a joke or to titillate or be so bloody frank about

the overwhelming noise we live with has made a fundamental pleasure like sex somehow less exciting less satisfying than it was for our libidinous forefathers and mothers  it seems to me that for sex and other pleasures to be enjoyed to the fullest a certain contemplative quality to life must be present  if you doubt this imagine yourself for a moment having sex  now imagine you wished to increase the pleasure you were feeling feel it more intensely  what might you do  well one of the things youd probably do is close your eyes  what this does of course is shut out other stimuli  the visual quiet increases your sensual enjoyment and you concentrate more fully on the pleasure  the same is true for the removal of auditory noise as well  well my feeling is that the average person has a much harder time doing this than they would have decades ago  you close your eyes and shut off television but the noise persists  its part of our fabric now our biology and all other pleasures including sex are diminished as a result  we dont notice this derogation by the way and sex still feels great dont get me wrong but i think the difference is there nonetheless  like the difference between seeing breasts when youre thirty as opposed to when you were thirteen

you can get a large audience together for a striptease act—that is to watch a girl undress on the stage now suppose you came to a country where you could fill a theatre by simply bringing a covered plate on to the stage and then slowly lifting the cover so as to let every one see just before the lights went out that it contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon would you not think that in that country something had gone wrong with the appetite for food

huddled in her mink in the kansas city airport she had a vision of women writing about sex as openly as male writers but quite quite differently  some women would treat sex much as men didas conquest as adventurein a way as mccarthy had  other women would treat female sexuality far less romantically then men who did not consider themselves romantics like hemingway were wont to  the earth would not move no there would be more biology and less theatrics  women had less ego involvement in sex than men did but far more at stake economically

firen didn’t waste any time setting up the meeting with egnatious the following day she was in such a rush to tell me about it that she burst into my room without knocking and found andrew and me in an intimate and compromising position reminiscent of the game twister also i cannot confirm or deny if there was food involved let’s just say i toppled over in embarrassment taking andrew down with me in a great heap firen didn’t fare any better as she nearly knocked herself out when she ran into the doorframe in an attempt to escape we were both scarred for life especially after firen apologized for walking in on our naked fun time which was apparently what joseph called it there were some things people should never know and that was one of them

girls say to me very reasonably why isnt it a bunch of girls why did you write this about a bunch of boys well my reply is i was once a little boy  i have been a brother a father i am going to be a grandfather i have never been a sister or a mother or a grandmother thats one answer another answer is of course to say that if you  as it were  scaled down human beings scaled down society if you land with a group of little boys they are more ike a scaleddown version of society than a group of little girls would be dont ask me why and this is a terrible thing to say because im going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality  this is nothing to do with equality at all i think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men they are far superior and always have been but one thing you cant do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down so to speak into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilisation of society the other thing is  why arent they little boys and little girls well if theyd been little boys and little girls we being who we are sex would have raised its lovely head and i didnt want this to be about sex sex is too trivial a thing to get in with a story like this which was about the problem of evil and the problem of how people are to live together in a society not just as lovers or man and wife
